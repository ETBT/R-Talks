# Synopsis
Stock market analysis is fun and potentially profitable. This presentation will use the package __tidyquant__ created by Matt Dancho^[1](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyquant)^. From the tidyquant documentation^[2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyquant/vignettes/TQ00-introduction-to-tidyquant.html)^, "All tidyquant functions return data in the tibble (tidy data frame) format, which allows for interaction within the tidyverse. ... The tidyquant package includes charting tools to assist users in developing quick visualizations in ggplot2 using the grammar of graphics format and workflow. ... Asset and portfolio performance analysis is a deep field with a wide range of theories and methods for analyzing risk versus reward." Source code is available on GitHub^[3](https://github.com/business-science/tidyquant)^. The tidyquant website^[4](https://business-science.github.io/tidyquant/)^ is another good source of information.
